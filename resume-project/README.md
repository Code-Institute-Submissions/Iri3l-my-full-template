# Welcome to My CV

#### This is my CV which I'll upgrade it constantly, I haven't done any changes to my CV desing because:
1st I like it how is it now until I will change my mind.
2nd I keep it as a tribute for "Code Institute" where I learn how to make it.

The plan is to crate a new page to my CV where I can add the projects that I'm working or good lessons.
