# Lazarovici Web Design

**Welcome!**

This project is my online CV  where I want to show to my clients and my employers who I am and what I'm doing. I also work on adding different projects on what I'm working on so everyone can see them.

## UX

The idea of this project is to offer to my potential clients, and my potential employers details about who I am, the work that I'm doing it. My idea about this project is to make this project as my online visit card for who is interested in my services.

* By promoting my CV, I can attract potential customers or employers and having more chances to be found on the internet and social media.
